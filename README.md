Clustering

Task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters)

Career clustering also supports the design of consistent, high-quality Career Technical Education (CTE) programs that prepare learners for the changing and interconnected world of work.
By using career clusters, educators can tailor programs to meet the evolving needs of industries and ensure that students are equipped with the necessary skills for future careers.
